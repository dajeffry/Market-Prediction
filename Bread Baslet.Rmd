DataSet -> (https://www.kaggle.com/mittalvasu95/the-bread-basket)

**Report Outline**
1. Data Extraction  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis  
3. Modelling  
4. Evaluation  
5. Recommendation 

## 1. Data Extraction

The Dataset is downlaoded from kaggle and saved in the data folder. we used read_excel function to read the dataset and put in bread data frame.

```{r}
library(readxl)
bread_df <- read_excel("data/bread-basket.xlsx")
```

To see the number of rows and column from data frame, we used dim fuction. The dataset has 20507 rows and 5 columns.

```{r}
dim(bread_df)
```

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

To find out the column names and types, we used **str() function
To find out the the first 6 transactions, we used **head() function
To find out the sumamry from this transactions, we used **summary() function

```{r}
str(bread_df)
head(bread_df)
summary(bread_df)
```

From the result above, we know the following:
1. The second column is **Item**. this should be a class variable, Currently the type is **char** and it should be converted to **factor**  
2. The third column is **date_time**. this should be a class variable, Currently the type is **char** and it should be converted to **Date**

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
